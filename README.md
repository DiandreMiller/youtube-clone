# Three M's Tube
[Three M's Tube Project](https://three-m-youtube.netlify.app) is a web development project that aims to create a replica of the YouTube website, providing users with a similar experience to the original site. Our team of three developers worked towards creating a fully functional clone of YouTube's features. The project's primary goal was to offer users a seamless experience and a chance to enjoy the features and functionalities of YouTube in a familiar environment.

Our team of developers utilized various technologies including React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a fully functional clone, including features such as search a video, watch the video, and additional features such as a hamburger menu, contact us, and about us pages. Additionally, we integrated the YouTube Data API, Email Js API and utilized Firebase for writing, saving, updating, and deleting comments. The platform also includes additional features such as a hamburger menu, contact us, and about us pages to enhance the user experience. 

With its user-friendly interface and advanced search options, the Three M's Tube Project offers a seamless experience for users looking to enjoy the functionality of YouTube. The project was completed within a duration of 7 days.
