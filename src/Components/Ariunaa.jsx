                Hi, I'm Ariunaa, a first-generation American originally from the Ulan-Ude
                region in Russia, and I take great pride in my Buryat-Mongolian heritage.
                My interest in software engineering started with graphic design and 3D modeling
                applications for jewelry, which eventually led me down the path of becoming a
                software engineer. In my free time, I enjoy reading books and exploring the
                endless possibilities that technology brings to our lives.

                The Pursuit program has been an incredible experience for me, providing a safe
                and supportive space to learn and grow as an individual. The program's commitment
                to fostering a nurturing community is inspiring and has helped me achieve my goals.
                I am grateful for the resources, mentorship, and opportunities for growth that
                Pursuit has provided me.

                Staying physically active is one of my passions, and I used to practice Muay Thai
                for a few years. Nowadays, I love exploring new physical activities and
                discovering new places in nature. There's nothing like pushing your body to its
                limits and experiencing the beauty of our natural world. I find that physical
                activity not only benefits my health but also helps me clear my mind and feel
                energized throughout the day.

                I believe that meaningful work involves creating a sustainable future and
                restoring balance to our environment. Our world faces numerous challenges,
                including climate change and the threat of nuclear weapons, especially in the
                country I once called home. I believe that it's our responsibility to take action
                and do our part in creating a more sustainable and equitable future for all.
                Whether through innovative technologies, policy changes, or individual actions,
                we all have a role to play in protecting our planet and ensuring the well-being
                of future generations.
