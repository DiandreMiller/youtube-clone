                Hi my name is Diandre and I am 29 years. I am a first generation
                American from Brooklyn, NY. I am currently a student at Pursuit learning
                various programming languages and frameworks such as JavaScript, React, Node,
                CSS, Bootstrap, and Express. I am also learning how to use various tools such as
                Git, GitHub, and vscode. I truly enjoy building web applications from scratch
                and the problem solving required to learn these skills. 

                Prior to joining Pursuit, I had a background in journalism and political
                science.
